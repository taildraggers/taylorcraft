# Taylorcraft

Daily aggregator of Taylorcraft classified listings (BC-12D, BC-65,
DCO-65, DC-65, L-2, F-19, F-21, F-22, and their letter-suffixed variants)
from [Barnstormers.com](https://www.barnstormers.com), published as a
static page (`docs/index.html`) meant to be embedded via `<iframe>` on
taildraggers.com.

Controller.com was evaluated (in the companion [Aeronca](https://github.com/taildraggers/aeronca)
repo) and dropped: its search results are only reachable through an internal
client-side widget (not a plain URL), which a headless browser can't drive
reliably for an unattended daily job.

Note: in the companion [Aviat](https://github.com/taildraggers/aviat),
[CubCrafters](https://github.com/taildraggers/cub-crafters),
[de Havilland](https://github.com/taildraggers/de-Havilland),
[Maule](https://github.com/taildraggers/maule),
[Van's RV](https://github.com/taildraggers/vans),
[RANS](https://github.com/taildraggers/rans),
[Luscombe](https://github.com/taildraggers/luscombe),
[Just Aircraft](https://github.com/taildraggers/just-aircraft),
[Kitfox](https://github.com/taildraggers/kitfox),
[Bellanca](https://github.com/taildraggers/bellanca),
[Stearman](https://github.com/taildraggers/stearman),
[Waco](https://github.com/taildraggers/waco), and
[Pitts](https://github.com/taildraggers/pitts) repos, Barnstormers'
single-manufacturer category pages turned out to include unrelated
listings mixed in with no distinguishing HTML markup. This repo is built
with the same fix from day one: `scraper/barnstormers.py` filters by
title against a small allowlist (see `TARGET_MODEL_PHRASES` in
`scraper/barnstormers.py`) before publishing.

Taylorcraft model codes (`BC-12D`, `BC-65`, `DCO-65`, `DC-65`, `L-2`,
`F-19`, `F-21`, `F-21A`, `F-21B`, `F-22`, `F-22A`) are short and
generic-looking enough that, unlike RANS's S-numbers or Luscombe's
8-series codes, they are **not** trusted standalone - every model match
requires the title to also say "Taylorcraft" explicitly (the same lesson
learned the hard way in the companion Piper repo, where a bare "Cub"
mislabeled non-Piper homebuilts as genuine Pipers). On top of that, and
the lesson learned in the companion Stearman/Waco/Pitts repos, a bare
mention of "Taylorcraft" with no specific model code stated is enough on
its own to publish too, since plenty of genuine listings don't state an
exact variant. Titles that read as parts, accessories, services, or
raffles are still dropped regardless. Every surviving listing's title is
rewritten to a canonical **`YEAR TAYLORCRAFT MODEL`** form when the ad
states a model year and a specific model (e.g. `1946 Taylorcraft BC-12D`),
`YEAR Taylorcraft` when only the model is missing, `TAYLORCRAFT MODEL`
when only the year is missing, or plain **`Taylorcraft`** when neither is
stated.

**Gear note:** most Taylorcraft models are conventional tailwheel-only,
but the F-22 is a genuine exception - some sources describe "F-22A"
specifically as the tricycle-gear version, while others describe the
whole F-22 line as offering a buyer's choice of tailwheel or tricycle gear
(unlike Van's RV, where the "A" suffix unambiguously always means
tricycle). Given that ambiguity, **no categorical model-based exclusion is
applied** for F-22A here - the standard text-based tricycle/nosewheel
safety net used in the RANS, Luscombe, Just Aircraft, Kitfox, Bellanca,
and Van's RV repos is relied on instead to catch specific tricycle-gear
F-22 ads via their own ad text.

## How it works

- `scraper/barnstormers.py` searches Barnstormers.com's Taylorcraft
  category for listings, follows pagination, then keeps only the ones
  whose URL slug matches the Taylorcraft allowlist (Barnstormers builds
  each listing's URL slug directly from the ad's own title, so this runs
  before any detail page is fetched). For the matches, it visits each
  listing's detail page to pull out the price, location, and posted date
  (falling back to regex heuristics over the visible text since the site
  doesn't expose structured data). The title is derived from the listing
  URL's own SEO slug, since every detail page shares one generic
  `<title>`/`<h1>`; the final parsed title is checked against the
  allowlist again as a safety net. Pagination is built directly from
  Barnstormers' known `?seocategory=<url-encoded-path>&page=<n>` URL
  pattern rather than discovered by following a "Next" link, since this
  category's pager renders as page-number buttons with no "Next" text or
  `rel="next"` attribute to find (a lesson learned the hard way in the
  companion Van's RV repo, where the link-following approach silently
  stopped after page 1).
- `main.py` runs the scraper, de-duplicates results, sorts them
  newest-posted-first, and renders them into `docs/index.html` titled
  **"Other Taylorcraft Ads on the Web"**, with one row per listing: Title
  (linked to the original ad), Price, Location, Date Posted, and Site
  Posted On. Below phone width, each row collapses into a card (title +
  price on one line, location/date/site on a smaller line below) instead
  of a horizontally-scrolling table. Below the table, a "Search More
  Taylorcraft Listings" section links out to Trade-A-Plane, Controller,
  and ASO - sites that block automated scraping, but are still worth
  sending visitors to directly via a pre-filled search. Links use
  `rel="noopener noreferrer"` and the page sets a `no-referrer` meta
  policy, so none of these sites see that the click came from
  taildraggers.com.
- `.github/workflows/daily-scrape.yml` runs the whole thing once a day (13:00 UTC),
  commits the regenerated `docs/index.html` if it changed, and can also be triggered
  manually from the Actions tab (`workflow_dispatch`).

## One-time setup: enable GitHub Pages

This repo publishes `docs/index.html` as a plain static file — GitHub Pages just needs
to be pointed at it once:

1. Go to **Settings → Pages** in this repository.
2. Under **Build and deployment → Source**, choose **Deploy from a branch**.
3. Branch: `main`, folder: `/docs`. Save.
4. GitHub will publish the page at `https://taildraggers.github.io/taylorcraft/`
   (may take a minute or two the first time).

Also check **Settings → Actions → General**:
- **Actions permissions**: "Allow all actions and reusable workflows".
- **Workflow permissions**: "Read and write permissions" (needed so the daily
  job can commit the regenerated page back to the repo).

## Embedding on taildraggers.com

```html
<iframe
  src="https://taildraggers.github.io/taylorcraft/"
  title="Other Taylorcraft Ads on the Web"
  style="width: 100%; height: 800px; border: 0;"
  loading="lazy">
</iframe>
```

The page also posts its rendered height to the parent window on load/resize
(`{ type: "taildraggers:resize", height }`) so it can be auto-sized instead
of using a fixed guessed height - add a matching `message` listener on the
embedding page to pick this up.

## Running locally

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install --with-deps chromium
python main.py
```

This writes/overwrites `docs/index.html`.

## Notes

- If Barnstormers changes its markup or is briefly unreachable, the run logs will
  show a `[warn]`/`[error]` line pointing at what broke rather than failing silently.
- The scraper identifies itself with a browser-like `User-Agent` and adds a short
  delay between requests to be polite to the site.
- Only one Barnstormers category is currently configured
  (`category-22538-Taildragger--Taylorcraft.html`). If listings turn out to be
  split across additional categories, add more URLs to `CATEGORY_URLS` in
  `scraper/barnstormers.py`.
